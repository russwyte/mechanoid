/** Distributed lock for FSM instances to ensure exactly-once transition semantics.
  *
  * When multiple nodes might process events for the same FSM instance concurrently, use this lock to ensure mutual
  * exclusion. Only the node holding the lock can process events; others wait or fail fast.
  *
  * ==Why Use Instance Locking?==
  *
  * Without locking, concurrent event processing relies on optimistic locking (sequence numbers) which detects conflicts
  * ''after'' they happen. This leads to:
  *   - Wasted work (processing that gets rejected)
  *   - Retry overhead
  *   - Potential for subtle race conditions
  *
  * With instance locking, conflicts are ''prevented'' rather than detected.
  *
  * ==Lock Semantics==
  *
  *   - '''Mutual exclusion''': Only one node can hold the lock at a time
  *   - '''Lease-based''': Locks expire automatically (crash recovery)
  *   - '''Reentrant-safe''': Same node can extend its own lock
  *   - '''Fair ordering''': Not guaranteed (depends on implementation)
  *
  * ==Usage==
  *
  * The lock is typically used automatically by `FSMRuntime.withLocking`:
  *
  * {{{
  * val program = ZIO.scoped {
  *   for
  *     fsm <- FSMRuntime.withLocking(orderId, definition, Pending)
  *     _   <- fsm.send(Pay)  // Lock acquired automatically
  *   yield ()
  * }.provide(eventStoreLayer, lockLayer)
  * }}}
  *
  * Or use directly for fine-grained control:
  *
  * {{{
  * lock.withLock(orderId, nodeId, 30.seconds) {
  *   // Exclusive access to this FSM instance
  *   fsm.send(Pay)
  * }
  * }}}
  *
  * ==PostgreSQL Implementation==
  *
  * {{{
  * CREATE TABLE fsm_instance_locks (
  *   instance_id  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  *   node_id      TEXT NOT NULL,
  *   acquired_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  *   expires_at   TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
  * );
  *
  * -- Acquire lock (atomic upsert if expired or same node)
  * INSERT INTO fsm_instance_locks (instance_id, node_id, acquired_at, expires_at)
  * VALUES ($1, $2, NOW(), NOW() + $3::interval)
  * ON CONFLICT (instance_id) DO UPDATE
  *   SET node_id = EXCLUDED.node_id,
  *       acquired_at = EXCLUDED.acquired_at,
  *       expires_at = EXCLUDED.expires_at
  *   WHERE fsm_instance_locks.expires_at < NOW()
  *      OR fsm_instance_locks.node_id = EXCLUDED.node_id

  /** Execute an effect while holding the lock with automatic heartbeat renewal.

    * Similar to [[withLock]], but also starts a background fiber that periodically renews the lock. This prevents lock

    *
    * ==FailFast vs Continue==
    *
    * When the heartbeat fails to renew the lock:
    *
    *   - '''FailFast''' (default): The main effect is interrupted immediately. This is safe for non-idempotent
    *     operations since another node may have acquired the lock.
    *   - '''Continue''': The `onLockLost` effect runs, then execution continues. Only use this for idempotent
    *     operations where completing is more important than safety.
    *
    * ==Usage==
    *
    * {{{
