/** A wrapper that adds distributed locking to an FSMRuntime.
  *
  * This ensures exactly-once transition semantics by acquiring a lock before processing each event. If another node is
  * processing the same FSM instance, the operation waits (up to timeout) or fails.
  *
  * ==Why Use Locking?==
  *
  * Without locking, concurrent event processing relies on optimistic locking which detects conflicts ''after'' the
  * fact. With distributed locking:
  *
  *   - Only one node processes events for an FSM at a time
  *   - No wasted work from rejected writes
  *   - Guaranteed exactly-once delivery per event
  *
  * ==Node Failure Resilience==
  *
  * Locks are lease-based and automatically expire. If a node crashes:
  *   1. Other nodes wait for the lock to expire
  *   2. Lock expires after `lockDuration`
  *   3. Another node acquires the lock and continues processing
  *
  * ==Zombie Node Protection==
  *
  * Even if a paused node wakes up after its lock expired:
  *   - The lock is validated before each operation (if configured)
  *   - EventStore's optimistic locking provides a final safety net
  *
  * ==Usage==

    *
    * Use this for orchestration logic that requires multiple transitions without interleaving from other nodes. The
    * heartbeat keeps the lock alive during the orchestration.
    *
    * ==When to Use==
    *
    *   - Conditional transitions based on intermediate state
    *   - Saga-like patterns where multiple events form one logical operation
    *   - Reading state between transitions for branching logic
    *
    * ==When NOT to Use (Anti-Patterns)==
    *
    * '''Do NOT use this for long-running work.''' That defeats the purpose of the lock (which should be held briefly)
    * and the Command pattern (which handles retries and recovery).
    *
    * '''Bad - Don't do this:'''
    * {{{
    * fsm.withAtomicTransitions() { ctx =>
    *   for
    *     _ <- ctx.send(StartProcessing)
    *     _ <- callExternalPaymentAPI()  // ❌ WRONG - should be a Command!
    *     _ <- ctx.send(CompleteProcessing)
    *   yield ()
    * }
    * }}}
    *
    * '''Good - Fast orchestration that generates Commands:'''
    * {{{
    * fsm.withAtomicTransitions() { ctx =>
    *   for
    *     outcome1 <- ctx.send(ValidateOrder)      // Generates ValidateCmd
    *     state    <- ctx.currentState
    *     _        <- if state.needsApproval
    *                 then ctx.send(RequestApproval) // Generates NotifyCmd
    *                 else ctx.send(AutoApprove)     // Generates ProcessCmd
    *   yield ()
    * }
    * // Commands are processed later by CommandWorker
    * }}}
    *
    * ==Lock Loss Behavior==
    *
    * By default, if the lock is lost (renewal fails), the effect is interrupted immediately (FailFast). This is safe
    * because another node may have acquired the lock. Use `Continue` only for idempotent operations.
    *
    * @param heartbeat
