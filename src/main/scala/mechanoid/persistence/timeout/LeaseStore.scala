/** Abstract storage trait for leader election leases.
  *
  * Implement this trait to persist leases to your chosen database. The [[LeaderElection]] service uses this to
  * coordinate which sweeper node is active.
  *
  * ==Implementation Requirements==
  *
  * '''CRITICAL''': The [[tryAcquire]] method MUST be atomic. Use database-level atomicity (e.g.,
  * `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` or `UPDATE ... WHERE`).
  *
  * ==Recommended Schema (PostgreSQL)==
  *
  * {{{
  * CREATE TABLE leases (
  *   key         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  *   holder      TEXT NOT NULL,
  *   expires_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  *   acquired_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
  * );
  * }}}
  *
  * ==Example PostgreSQL Implementation==
  *
  * {{{
  * class PostgresLeaseStore(xa: Transactor[Task]) extends LeaseStore:
  *
  *   def tryAcquire(key: String, holder: String, duration: Duration, now: Instant) =
  *     val expiresAt = now.plusMillis(duration.toMillis)
  *     sql"""
  *       INSERT INTO leases (key, holder, expires_at, acquired_at)
  *       VALUES ($key, $holder, $expiresAt, $now)
  *       ON CONFLICT (key) DO UPDATE
  *       SET holder = $holder, expires_at = $expiresAt, acquired_at = $now
  *       WHERE leases.expires_at < $now OR leases.holder = $holder
