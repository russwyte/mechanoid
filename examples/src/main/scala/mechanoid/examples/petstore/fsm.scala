/** Order lifecycle events with rich metadata.
  *
  * Events carry all context needed for effects. The suite-style DSL uses `event[T]` to match on TYPE (shape), ignoring
  * the parameter values. This allows the Machine definition to be declarative while runtime events carry actual data.
  *
  * Timeout events are simple case objects - they're fired automatically by the FSM runtime when a state's timeout
  * expires. Define handlers for them like any other event.
  *
  * Example:
  * {{{
  * // DSL matches ANY PaymentSucceeded by type
  * (PaymentProcessing via event[PaymentSucceeded] to Paid)
  *   .onEntry { (e, _) => ZIO.logInfo(s"Payment succeeded: ${e.transactionId}") }
  *
  * // Timeout handling - simple case object
  * PaymentProcessing via PaymentTimeout to Cancelled
  *
  * // At runtime, send with actual transaction data
  * fsm.send(PaymentSucceeded(orderId, txnId, customerId, customerName, ...))
  * }}}

/** Order FSM with timeouts and per-transition effects.
  *
  * This FSM demonstrates two key side effect patterns:
  *
  * '''`.onEntry`''' - Synchronous effects that run during the transition:
  *   - Used for logging, metrics, validation
  *   - Failures cause ActionFailedError and prevent the transition
  *
  * '''`.producing`''' - Async effects that produce events sent back to the FSM:
  *   - Used for external service calls (payment, shipping, notifications)
  *   - Fire-and-forget: forked as daemon fiber
  *   - Errors are logged but don't fail the original transition
  *   - Perfect for self-driving FSMs where services return result events
  *
  * '''Timeouts''' are configured using `@@ Aspect.timeout(duration, event)`. When the FSM enters the target state, a
  * timer starts. If no event fires before timeout, the specified event is automatically sent.
